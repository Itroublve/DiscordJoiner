# DiscordTokenManager
Started as a simple way to bypass the new joining system of Discord, and evolving to a more like manager tool, which now can check huge number of tokens faster then any checkers (only valid/invalid). I've also added other various features in case you're a token seller or in any other way might need it.


I'll probably not update this README.MD anymore, but, I'm definitive someone will skid this, legit rip off the whole thing and change name without any type of credits and claim it as their own work, if you come across anything like that kindly let me know.

Thank you,
